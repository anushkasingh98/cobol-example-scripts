# Samples/IC106A.CBL

Here's a summary of the given COBOL code file in markdown format:

### Data Structures
- `TABLE-1`: 10-element array of single characters, indexed by `IN1`
- `TABLE-2`: 10-element array of single characters, indexed by `IN2`
- `IDN1`: Index data item
- Various test result and reporting structures

### Inputs / Outputs
- Output: `PRINT-FILE` for writing test results

### Main Procedure
- Initializes `TABLE-1` with "ABCDEFGHIJ"
- Sets `IN1` to 6 and `IDN1` to `IN1`
- Calls subprogram "IC107A" with `IDN1`, `TABLE-1`, and `TABLE-2`
- Performs several tests:
  - Verifies separate indexes between main program and subprogram
  - Checks if index data item was used correctly in subprogram
  - Tests subprogram index for table in linkage section
  - Verifies index data item set in subprogram can be used in main program
  - Checks if data was moved between tables in subprogram
  - Tests redefined item in linkage section of subprogram
- Writes test results to output file
