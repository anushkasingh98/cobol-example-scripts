# Samples/IC108A.CBL

Here's a summary of the given COBOL code file:

### File Handling
- Opens and writes to `PRINT-FILE` ("report.log")

### Data Structures
- `GRP-01`: Group item containing subprogram call information
  - `SUB-CALLED`: Subprogram names (X(6))
  - `TIMES-CALLED`: Call counters (S999)
  - `SPECIAL-FLAGS`: Flags (X)
- Various test result and reporting structures

### Main Procedure
1. Initializes test environment
2. Calls subprogram "IC109A" using `GRP-01`
3. Verifies subprogram calls:
   - Checks if IC109A, IC110A, and IC111A were called
   - Ensures each subprogram was called only once
4. Validates USING phrase operands from subprogram working-storage sections
5. Generates test report
6. Closes files and terminates program

The program tests the execution of a sequence of subprogram calls and verifies the correct passing of parameters between programs.
