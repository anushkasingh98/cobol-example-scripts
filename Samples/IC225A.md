Here's a summary of the COBOL code file:

### File Handling
- Uses PRINT-FILE for output, assigned to "report.log"

### Data Structures
- Working Storage:
  - DN1, DN3: PIC S99
  - DN2, DN4: PIC S99 USAGE COMPUTATIONAL
  - Various counters and flags (e.g., CALL-COUNT, FAIL-FLAG)
- Linkage Section in IC225A-1:
  - DN1, DN2, DN3, DN4 (same as Working Storage)

### Inputs / Outputs
- Outputs test results to PRINT-FILE

### Main Procedure
- Performs multiple CALL tests:
  - Tests basic CALL statement with BY REFERENCE and CONTENT
  - Tests using data-name more than once in USING phrase
  - Tests ON OVERFLOW phrase (syntactical check only)
- Calls subprogram IC225A-1 multiple times with different parameter combinations
- IC225A-1 subprogram:
  - Receives parameters, performs simple calculations, and returns results
