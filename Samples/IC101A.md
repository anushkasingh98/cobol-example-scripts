# Samples/IC101A.CBL

Here's a summary of the given COBOL code:

### File Handling
- Opens and writes to `PRINT-FILE` ("report.log")

### Data Structures
- `DN1`, `DN2`: S9 (signed single-digit integer)
- Various structures for test results and reporting

### Main Procedure
1. Initializes the program and opens files
2. Performs five CALL tests:
   - Calls "IC102A" subprogram using `DN1` or `DN2` as parameter
   - Checks returned values in `DN1` or `DN2`
   - Expected values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively
3. Prints test results
4. Closes files and terminates

### Inputs / Outputs
- Input: None explicitly defined
- Output: Writes test results to `PRINT-FILE`

The program tests the CALL statement with one parameter in the USING phrase, verifying that the called routine maintains its last used state across multiple calls.
