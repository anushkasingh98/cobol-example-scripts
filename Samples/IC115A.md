### File Handling
- Opens, reads, writes, and closes sequential file SQ-FS3
- File contains 649 records, 120 characters each

### Data Structures
- FILE-RECORD-INFORMATION-REC: Complex structure for file metadata
- SQ-FS3R1-F-G-120: 120-character record for SQ-FS3 file
- GROUP-LINKAGE-VARIABLES: Linkage section for inter-program communication
- FILE-REC-SQ-FS3: Linkage section for file record

### Inputs / Outputs
- Reads from and writes to SQ-FS3 file
- Communicates with main program IC114 via linkage section

### Main Procedure
- Multiple sections controlled by CALL-FLAG
- Creates and populates SQ-FS3 file
- Reads and verifies file contents
- Handles file operations for main program
- Moves read data to linkage section for main program verification
