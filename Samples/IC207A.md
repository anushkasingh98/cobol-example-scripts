# Samples/IC207A.CBL

Here's a summary of the given COBOL code file in markdown format:

### Data Structures
- `TABLE-01`: Variable-length table with 1-15 occurrences of `DN1` (PIC X)
- `TABLE-02`: Fixed-length table with 8 occurrences of `DN2` (PIC X)
- Various other data items for testing and reporting

### Inputs / Outputs
- `PRINT-FILE`: Output file for test results

### Main Procedure
- Initializes `TABLE-01` with "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO"
- Sets index `IN1` to 3
- Calls subprogram `IC208A` with parameters:
  - `TABLE-01`
  - `TABLE-02`
  - `INDEX-1`
  - `DN3` (table length)
- Performs tests to verify:
  - Correct passing of index data item
  - Processing of variable-length table
  - Handling of condition names in subprogram
  - Correct return of modified parameters
- Checks values in `TABLE-02` to confirm subprogram operations
- Verifies changes made to `INDEX-1` and `DN3` by subprogram
