# Samples/IC234A.CBL

### File Handling
- Opens and closes TEST-FILE
- Reads from TEST-FILE

### Data Structures
- PRINT-REC: PIC X(120)
- TEST-RECORD: PIC X(20)
- DILFRAP: PIC 9 (global)
- Various test result structures (TEST-RESULTS, TEST-COMPUTED, TEST-CORRECT)

### Inputs / Outputs
- PRINT-FILE for output
- TEST-FILE for input

### Main Procedure
- Nested program structure: IC234A -> IC234A-1 -> IC234A-2 -> IC234A-3
- Tests USE procedures across nested programs
- IC234A: Opens/closes TEST-FILE, calls IC234A-1
- IC234A-1: Calls IC234A-2
- IC234A-2: Calls IC234A-3
- IC234A-3: Opens TEST-FILE for input, reads record
- USE procedures defined at different levels to test invocation
