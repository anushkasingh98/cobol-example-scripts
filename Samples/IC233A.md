# Samples/IC233A.CBL

Here's a summary of the given COBOL code:

### File Handling
- Uses PRINT-FILE for output
- Uses TEST-FILE for input (optional)

### Data Structures
- Various counters and flags (e.g., DILFRAP, TEST-RESULTS)
- Test-related structures (e.g., TEST-COMPUTED, TEST-CORRECT)
- Report formatting structures (e.g., CCVS-H-1, CCVS-E-1)

### Inputs / Outputs
- Writes test results to PRINT-FILE
- Reads from TEST-FILE in contained program IC233A-1

### Main Procedure
- Initializes test environment
- Calls contained program IC233A-1
- Checks if USE procedure was invoked (DILFRAP = 1)
- Prints test results
- IC233A-1 program opens and reads TEST-FILE, triggering USE procedure in main program
