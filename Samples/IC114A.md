Here's a summary of the given COBOL code file:

### Data Structures
- `FILE-REC-SQ-FS3`: Record structure for file SQ-FS3
- `GROUP-LINKAGE-VARIABLES`: Contains counters and flags for file operations
- Various test result and reporting structures

### Inputs / Outputs
- `PRINT-FILE`: Output file for test results

### Main Procedure
- Opens output file
- Performs test setup routines
- Executes LINK-TEST-10 to create file SQ-FS3 via subprogram IC115A
- Executes LINK-TEST-11 to verify file SQ-FS3
- Executes LINK-TEST-12 to read and validate contents of SQ-FS3
- Calls subprogram IC115A multiple times with different CALL-FLAG values
- Checks for correct record count, file structure, and data integrity
- Prints test results
- Closes files and terminates program
