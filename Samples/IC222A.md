### Data Structures
- Working-Storage:
  - WS1: S999
  - WS2: S999 COMPUTATIONAL
- Linkage:
  - DN1, DN3: S99
  - DN2, DN4: S99 COMPUTATIONAL

### Inputs / Outputs
- Input: DN1, DN2 (parameters)
- Output: DN3, DN4 (modified parameters)

### Main Procedure
- Moves DN1 to WS1
- Adds 1 to WS1 and WS2
- Moves WS1 to DN3
- Moves WS2 to DN4
- Exits program

This program appears to be a simple subroutine that increments two input parameters and returns the results.
